Tiffany's Breakfast: 
Paul: Holly I am in love with you.
Holly: So what.
Paul: So what? So plenty! I love you, you belong to me!
Holly: [tearfully] No. People don't belong to people.
Paul: Of course they do!
Holly: I'll never let anybody put me in a cage.
Paul: I don't want to put you in a cage, I want to love you!
Holly: It's the same thing!
Paul: Holly!
Holly: I'm not Holly. I'm not Lulamae either. I don't know who I am. I'm like cat here,  We're a couple of no name slobs. We belong to nobody and nobody belongs to us. We don't even belong to each other.
[...]
Paul: You call yourself a free spirit, a "wild thing," and you're terrified somebody's gonna stick you in a cage. Well baby, you're already in that cage. You built it yourself. And it's not bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or in the east by Somali-land. It's wherever you go. Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.
Paul: I've been carrying this thing around for months. I don't want it anymore.
