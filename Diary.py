Tiffany's Breakfast: 
Paul: Holly I am in love with you.
Holly (Audrey Hepburn): So what.
Paul: So what? So plenty! I love you, you belong to me!
Holly: [tearfully] No. People don't belong to people.
Paul: Of course they do!
Holly: I'll never let anybody put me in a cage.
Paul: I don't want to put you in a cage, I want to love you!
Holly: It's the same thing!
Paul: Holly!
Holly: I'm not Holly. I'm not Lulamae either. I don't know who I am. I'm like cat here,  We're a couple of no name slobs. We belong to nobody and nobody belongs to us. We don't even belong to each other.
[...]
Paul: You call yourself a free spirit, a "wild thing," and you're terrified somebody's gonna stick you in a cage. Well baby, you're already in that cage you built it yourself. And it's not bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or in the east by Somali-land. It's wherever you go. Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.
Paul: I've been carrying this thing around for months. I don't want it anymore. 

Penny Dreadful:
Vanessa (Eva Green): Are you leaving? 
Monster (Frankenstein's monster): Yes. 
Vanessa: For long? 
Monster: For ever. 
Vanessa: Where will you go?
Monster: Where I belong. Away from mankind. 
Vanassa: I think you are the most human man... I have ever known. 
Monster: This dream I had ... This long dream of kinship with those unlike me, it is gone. When you’ve seen that of which you are capable, when you’ve stood in blood long enough ... What is left but to wade into a delosate shore? Away from all others. 

Cowboy Bebop: 
Faye: 何は無事たﾞね全く。 真不知道他在干什么
Spike: たまに故郷も 会いに行くのさ。 只是想去看看过去的故乡吧
Faye: 昔の女は 今てﾞも君のことを考えてると思うたﾞったら 大間違いよ。 如果以为原来的女人现在还想着自己那就大错特错了

Camus:
There is not love of life without despair about life. 
于是我悟出了，一个人即使只生活过一天，他也可以在监狱待上一百年而不至于难以度日，他有足够的东西可供回忆，决不会感到烦闷无聊。从某种意义上来说，这也是一种愉快。
他说他一直在研究我的灵魂，结果发现其中空虚无物。他说我实际上没有灵魂，没有丝毫人性，没有任何一条在人类灵魂中占神圣地位的道德原则，所有这些都与我格格不入。为了把一切都做的完美，为了使我感到不那么孤独，我还希望处决我的那一天有很多人来观看，希望他们对我报以仇恨的喊叫声。

Shelley:
The pleasure that is in sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure itself.
